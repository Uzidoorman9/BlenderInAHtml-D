CynIous3D — A Blender-Style 3D Suite Inside a Single Offline HTML File

CynIous3D is a concept for a lightweight but powerful 3D creation suite designed to run entirely offline from just one HTML file. Inspired by Blender’s workflow, CynIous3D focuses on accessibility, portability, and zero-install convenience while still offering a full creative toolset.

Core Idea

CynIous3D opens in any modern browser and instantly becomes a mini 3D studio. No downloads, no servers, no setup — just a clean, self-contained environment where you can model, sculpt, texture, animate, and render directly on your device.

Key Features
• Modeling Tools

Includes the classic modeling workflow: vertices, edges, faces, extrusions, loop cuts, beveling, mirroring, and basic modifiers. Ideal for quick prototypes or detailed meshes.

• Sculpting Mode

Brush-based sculpting with smooth, crease, and inflate tools. Real-time normal updates allow organic shape crafting even in an offline environment.

• Materials & Shading

A simplified PBR material system lets you adjust color, metallic, roughness, normal maps, and texture inputs. All textures are loaded locally from your device.

• UV Editing & Painting

Automatic UV unwrapping, island packing, and a basic 2D paint panel allow quick texture adjustments without external software.

• Animation System

Keyframe animation with a timeline, interpolation options, and basic rigging helpers. Export animations to formats like glTF for use in engines or other tools.

• Offline Renderer

A small WebGL2/JS-powered progressive renderer provides path-traced previews, denoising, and final PNG exports — all computed locally in your browser.

Why Offline?

CynIous3D is designed for:

privacy (your models never leave your device)

portability (carry one HTML file anywhere)

classrooms, Chromebooks, and restricted systems

quick prototyping without installing full 3D software

Supported Formats

CynIous3D aims to support OBJ, glTF, PNG, and a custom JSON scene format. Everything loads and saves through simple browser file dialogs.

Target Use Cases

quick modeling and concept sculpting

educational use in environments with download restrictions

portable 3D toolkit for students and creators

on-the-go previewing, editing, and rendering
